Here they come. We move when they get close, hit fast and hard because if the supplies reach the frontlines we will be stuck in this battle for hours.

§RoadAmbush02
@Perfect Measure
Recruit you are a thief right? This ambush and steal should be business as usual.
@Moonlight
Former thief…. 
@Perfect Measure
Whatever. You have held a weapon and you are good at sneaking, you fit the bill. I expect to see results, this is your trial run so you best make a good impression.
@Rusty
Ease up Perfect. Just follow my lead alright kid? I’ll soften em up.
@Moonlight
Yeah alright, I got this.
@Perfy
Just remember the supply team is going to try and get away, make sure we down them as fast as possible.
